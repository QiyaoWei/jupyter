Applying fully-connected to MNIST is not susceptible to the same change in solver tolerance. I think there are two interesting observations here:\n\n* Changing the solver tolerance causes the model to breakdown in some mdeq models but not fully-connected models. In other words, only in certain mdeq models do we see different solvers finding different steady states\n* Not all mdeq models break under solver change, though. skip mdeq somehow manages to resist the change in solver tolerance, whereas vanilla mdeq does not.\n\n\nMy hypothesis for why this happens:\n\n* mdeq could be more sophisticated than fully-connected networks, in the sense that there are more steady states for the mdeq network. That is why the solver tolerance matters for the steady state.\n* I think it's confusing why skip mdeq doesn't have this issue. I should also point out that it doesn't matter whether we add the regularization term, i.e. skip and skip_with_no_extra_params can both use cheaper solvers in test time even though it is trained with lower tolerance."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.15","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
